Rechargeable designer is a paradigm shift for freelancers|clients relationships.

##### How to deal with clients who don't know what they want?

##### Prevent clients changing idea half way through the work?

##### How to deal with high-uncertainty job requests?

##### Why spend so much time forging and explaining the way you want to work?

In all the above cases there's lots of time involved in solving these problems, time that's either not accounted for in the job quotation, or an upfront free work that will be included when and if the contract for the work will be signed.

As in advertising it's easier to hit a ready made "concept" in the mind of the target.

So whos not accustomed to recharge personal services as Prepaid-sim-card, Pay-to-go, Pay-per-view, you probably don't wanna have as client.

While many telephone companies are driving people crazy with variations on their Prepaid-sim-card business model, it's sober for a freelancer to keep it dead simple.

Dependencies of the deal we are signing are also details like enthusiasm about the work, ethos, pathos, sympathy for the client, willingness to work hard to deliver a better product. Such nuances sometimes get the product to funny ends.
